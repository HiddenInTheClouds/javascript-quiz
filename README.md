# javascript-quiz

## Description

This code was created to make a user be quizzed on fundamentals of JavaScript. To build this code, I needed to create the skeleton for my website which is the index.html. Then I needed to create another html application which displays the highscore portion of the application. Once those two html pages were created, I needed to create two different javascripts for both the questions and the highscore.

## Installation

To install the project one must make sure the javascripts are placed right before the closing body tag in the html. 

## Usage

To use the application, one must click on the Start Quiz button. Then you are giving a limited amount of time to answer the questions. If you answer incorrectly then time is deducted from your remaining time. At the end of the quiz you are told how many answers you got right, and have the ability to put in your initials for your highscore which will be logged into local storage. If you want to take the quiz again you can click on the back button.
